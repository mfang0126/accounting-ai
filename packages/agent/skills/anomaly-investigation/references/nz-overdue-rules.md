# NZ Overdue Payment Rules & Debt Collection

## Standard Payment Terms (NZ)

- **Default:** 20th of the month following invoice (common in trade)
- **Construction/Trades:** Often 30 days from invoice date
- **Government/Council:** Typically 20-30 days

## Overdue Thresholds for Accounting Judgment

| Days Overdue | Status | Accounting Action |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| 0-30 | Current | Normal AR, no action needed |
| 31-60 | Overdue | Send payment reminder, note in working paper |
| 61-90 | Significantly overdue | Formal follow-up, consider doubtful debt provision |
| 90+ | Seriously overdue | Doubtful debt provision required, consider write-off |

## GST on Bad Debts (NZ Specific)

Under NZ GST Act, if a debt is written off as bad:
- The supplier can claim back the GST previously returned on that sale
- Must be genuinely written off (not just doubtful)
- Adjustment made in the GST return for the period the debt is written off

## Payroll Discrepancies (NZ Context)

Common reasons bank payroll differs from GL wages:
- **PAYE deductions** — employer withholds and pays to IRD separately
- **KiwiSaver** — minimum 3% employer contribution, employee contribution deducted
- **ACC levies** — may be deducted from wages in some arrangements
- **Student loan repayments** — withheld and paid to IRD

When bank payment > GL wages, check if super/leave loading was coded separately.
When bank payment < GL wages, check PAYE/KiwiSaver coding.

# Workflow Runners

Mastra [workflows](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview) can be executed using the built-in workflow runner or deployed to specialized workflow execution platforms that handle orchestration, monitoring, and reliability.

## Inngest

Inngest is a developer platform for running background workflows without managing infrastructure. Mastra workflows can be deployed to Inngest, which provides step memoization, automatic retries, real-time monitoring, and suspend/resume capabilities.

Visit the [Inngest deployment guide](https://mastra.ai/guides/deployment/inngest) for setup instructions and the [Inngest workflow example](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/examples/inngest) for a complete implementation.
